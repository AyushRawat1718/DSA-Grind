//  Problem Statement: Find the number that appears once, and the other numbers twice

//  Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/description/

/*
 @Approach:
 - Approach_1: We could perform hashing using map instead of array, as it would be more relevant
 
 - Approach_2: Use the concept of XOR, i.e a^a = 0 and a^0 = a, traverse in the whole array and xor all the elements, The numbers that appear twice will cancel each other using XOR (a^a = 0), and weâ€™ll be left with the one that appears only once.

 @Complexity:
 - Time: 
    - Approach_1: O(N*logM) + O(M)=>Traversing the array and inserting in map, and then traversing map, m is the size of map
    - Approach_2: O(n)
 - Space: 
    - Approach_1: O(m) => m is the size of map, m would be approx (n/2) + 1
    - Approach_2: O(1)
